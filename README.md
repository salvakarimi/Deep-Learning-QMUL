# Deep-Learning-QMUL
This project implements and experiments with a weighted-block convolutional neural network for CIFAR-10 image classification. Each intermediate block contains multiple parallel convolutional branches; their outputs are linearly combined with learned coefficients derived from a global-average summary of the input feature map.
